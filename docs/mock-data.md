## Project setup

1. At the start of project, I found these two fake rest API providers that can be used for getting test todos data

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/  
https://dummyjson.com/

I used dummyjson since it provides  
a. real-life todos  
b. ability to 'skip/ take' limited todos

2. Later on, I transitioned to building todos which can be persisted locally and then in a sqlite db.
